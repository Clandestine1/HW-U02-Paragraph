#####Server side programming is a complex process, servers correspond with eachother in order to generate and execute webpages.

#### What is the client server round trip? What is the request? What is the response?
The client server round trip is the repeating process of the client sending requests to the server and the server responding to the requests. The client request is a url that identifies the resource and a method that requires action like getting, deleting or posting the resource. The server response is a status line that indicates if the request was a success or failure, and can be displayed in the browser. 

#### What is a server? Name some different servers.
Web servers are what web browsers use to communicate with eachother using HTTP.Some different servers are APache, IIS, and GWS. The most popular server is Apache. These servers are the basic protocol for distributing information on the internet. 

#### Explain headers. What are they and how are they used?
The header is the first part of the client request. It is useful because it contains specific information about the request, similar to the HTML head. The header contains a numerical response code, Content-Type, text/html charset and Content Length.
